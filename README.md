# PyQtOpenGLCanvas

I use Anaconda to develop this project (https://www.continuum.io/downloads). The folder .idea contains configuration files for PyCharm. If you don't use PyCharm, just ignore the folder. This project can also run using Spyder IDE by executing Demo.py.

To do:
* Parse and Render SVG using OpenGL and QT
* Need to full screen shading
